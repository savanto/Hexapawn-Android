    <string name="instructions_message">
        Hexapawn is a game invented by Martin Gardner,
        designed to be played against a mechanical computer
        built out of matchboxes and jelly beans.
        This game is not meant to be fun, but rather to
        demonstrate the computer\'s ability to \"learn\" to play
        the game well over time.\n\n-
        Pawns move the same way as in chess &#8212; 
        forward one square, or capture diagonally.\n\n-
        A player wins by advancing a pawn to the opponent\'s home row,
        capturing all opponent pawns, or blocking all opponent
        pawns from making a move.
